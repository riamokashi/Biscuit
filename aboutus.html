Hi, my name is Ria! I am an incoming freshman at Michigan State University. I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science. Before I started CSSI, I had no coding experience at all. By the end of the program, I was able to work with my amazing teammates to build this entire web application in only 4 days, along with the help of our instructors. I had an amazing experience at Google Detroit in CSSI, and I am so excited to see what else the future will bring me in my tech career!</ul>
<ul>Hey, I'm Marcux, I did the Art Direction & UX/UI for Biscuit. I'm going to RISD for Graphic Design and Industrial Design. Google CSSI was opportunity to exoand my range of mediums. The interactivity and instantous nature of programming is what really attracted me to it, other mediums have certain constraints that restrict your ideas while programming there's so much flexibillity. </ul>
<ul> I'm Robert Bush and I'll be attending Brown University in the fall. I intend to concentrate in Computer Science, alongside exploring infinite other interests and opportunities along the way.</ul>
